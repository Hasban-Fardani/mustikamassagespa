## Infrastructure

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers
- **Database:** D1
- **Storage:** R2
- **Framework:** Astro with `@astrojs/cloudflare`

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` builds the Cloudflare Worker, initializes the local D1 snapshot when needed, and starts Wrangler at `http://localhost:4321`. This keeps local development on the same D1/R2 Worker runtime used in production.

## Deploying

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

The deploy script links EmDash's `SESSION` binding to the existing Cloudflare
KV namespace before uploading the Worker. If the Cloudflare account contains
more than one session namespace, set `EMDASH_SESSION_KV_NAMESPACE_ID` in the
deployment environment to the intended namespace ID.

Cloudflare Workers Builds may keep its default deploy command
(`npx wrangler deploy`). The `postbuild` lifecycle patches Astro's generated
Wrangler configuration automatically, so the deploy stage reuses
`mustikamassagespa-session` instead of trying to create it again.

Or click the deploy button above to set up the project in your Cloudflare account.
